# Update Existing Hugging Face Space

## If You Already Have a Space

If you've already created a Hugging Face Space and want to update it with this code, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Get Your Space URL

Your Space repository URL should look like:
```
https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME
```

### Step 2: Add Remote and Pull (if not already done)

```bash
cd /Users/bobbymurphy/Documents/pace/cs676/project1

# Add your existing Space as a remote
git remote add hf https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME

# Pull the existing content from your Space
git pull hf main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

If your Space uses a different branch (like `master`), use:
```bash
git pull hf master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

### Step 3: Handle Conflicts (if any)

If there are conflicts between your local files and the Space:

```bash
# Check status
git status

# For each conflicted file, you can:
# Option A: Keep your local version
git checkout --ours path/to/file

# Option B: Keep the Space version
git checkout --theirs path/to/file

# Option C: Manually edit the file to resolve conflicts
# (Open the file and look for <<<<<<, ======, >>>>>> markers)

# After resolving all conflicts:
git add .
git commit -m "Merge local changes with existing Space"
```

### Step 4: Prepare README

Make sure your README has the Hugging Face metadata:

```bash
# Backup current README if needed
cp README.md README_BACKUP.md

# Use the prepared HF README
cp README_HF.md README.md

# Or manually add the header to your existing README
```

### Step 5: Push Updates

```bash
# Add all your changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Update Space with neural network features"

# Push to Hugging Face
git push hf main
```

If pushing to a different branch:
```bash
git push hf main:main  # Push local main to remote main
# or
git push hf master:main  # Push local master to remote main
```

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

1. Go to your Space: `https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME`
2. Check the "App" tab for build logs
3. Wait 3-5 minutes for the build to complete
4. Test your app!

## Alternative: Start Fresh

If you want to completely replace your existing Space with this code:

### Option A: Force Push (WARNING: Overwrites everything)

```bash
cd /Users/bobbymurphy/Documents/pace/cs676/project1

# Prepare README
cp README_HF.md README.md

# Initialize git if needed
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Complete update with neural network"

# Add remote
git remote add hf https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME

# Force push (CAUTION: This erases Space history)
git push hf main --force
```

### Option B: Delete and Recreate Space

1. Go to your Space settings
2. Delete the Space
3. Create a new Space with the same name
4. Follow the original deployment instructions

## Automated Script for Existing Spaces

You can also use the deployment script, which handles existing remotes:

```bash
./deploy_to_hf.sh
```

The script will detect if the `hf` remote already exists and handle it appropriately.

## Common Issues

### "Remote 'hf' already exists"

```bash
# Remove the old remote
git remote remove hf

# Add it again
git remote add hf https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME
```

### "Refusing to merge unrelated histories"

```bash
# Allow unrelated histories when pulling
git pull hf main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

### "Your branch has diverged"

```bash
# If you want to keep your local version:
git push hf main --force

# If you want to merge:
git pull hf main --rebase
git push hf main
```

## What's Your Current Situation?

Choose the approach that fits your needs:

1. **Empty Space or just has README**: Use original deployment instructions or force push
2. **Space has existing app code**: Pull first, merge changes, then push
3. **Want completely fresh start**: Delete Space and recreate, or force push
