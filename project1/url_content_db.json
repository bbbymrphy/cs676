The most common symptoms are fever, chills, and sore throat, but there are a range of others. Most people make a full recovery without needing hospital treatment. People with severe symptoms should seek medical care as soon as possible. Over 760 million cases and 6.9 million deaths have been recorded worldwide since December 2019, but the actual number is thought to be higher. Over 13 billion vaccine doses have been administered as of June 2023. Overview COVID-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. It usually spreads between people in close contact. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness and death. Although a person can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, they are more likely to have mild or no symptoms. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die, but most people will recover without treatment. People over age 60 and those with existing medical conditions have a higher risk of getting seriously ill. These conditions include high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression including HIV, cancer and pregnancy. Unvaccinated people also have a higher risk of severe symptoms. Symptoms People may experience different symptoms from COVID-19. Symptoms usually begin 5\u20136 days after exposure and last 1\u201314 days. The most common symptoms are: fever chills sore throat. Less common symptoms are: muscle aches and heavy      arms or legs severe fatigue or      tiredness runny or blocked nose,      or sneezing headache sore eyes dizziness new and persistent      cough tight chest or chest      pain shortness of breath hoarse voice numbness or tingling appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea loss or change of sense      of taste or smell difficulty sleeping. People with the following symptoms should seek immediate medical attention: difficulty breathing,      especially at rest, or unable to speak in sentences confusion drowsiness or loss of      consciousness persistent pain or      pressure in the chest skin being cold or      clammy, or turning pale or a bluish colour loss of speech or movement. People who have pre-existing health problems are at higher risk when they have COVID-19; they should seek medical help early if worried about their condition. These include people taking immunosuppressive medication; those with chronic heart, lung, liver or rheumatological problems; those with HIV, diabetes, cancer. obesity or dementia. People with severe disease and those needing hospital treatment should receive treatment as soon as possible. The consequences of severe COVID-19 include death, respiratory failure, sepsis, thromboembolism (blood clots), and multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys. In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection. Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms. These long-term effects are called long COVID (or post COVID-19 condition). The most common symptoms associated with long COVID include fatigue, breathlessness and cognitive dysfunction (for example, confusion, forgetfulness, or a lack of mental focus or clarity). Long COVID can affect a person\u2019s ability to perform daily activities such as work or household chores. Treatment Most people will recover without needing treatment in a hospital. For those who need it, doctors will suggest treatments for COVID-19 based on the severity of the disease and the risk of it getting worse. They will consider the person\u2019s age and if they have other health problems. More on treatment Prevention People should get vaccinated as soon as it\u2019s their turn. They should follow local guidance on vaccination and ways to protect themselves against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death. To prevent the spread of COVID-19: avoid crowds and keep a      safe distance from others, even if they don\u2019t appear to be sick; wear a properly fitted      mask if you feel sick, have been close to people who are sick, if you are      at high-risk, or in crowded or poorly ventilated areas; clean your hands      frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; cover your mouth and      nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze; dispose of used tissues      right away and clean your hands; and if you develop symptoms      or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover. Vaccination against COVID-19 is based on priority groups such as people aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic health problems, immunosuppression (including HIV), obesity, cancer, pregnant persons, and unvaccinated people. In March 2023, WHO updated its recommendations on primary series vaccination (two doses of any vaccine) as well as the need for booster doses. These recommendations are time-limited and can change at any time depending on how the SARS-CoV-2 virus is circulating in your area or country. It is important to stay up to date with local guidelines and recommendations provided by your local health authority. Since its introduction, COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives across the world by providing protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Even though vaccines protect against severe disease and death, it is still possible to spread SARS-CoV-2 to others after being vaccinated. WHO response The World Health Organization is the global coordinating agency for the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Organization works with Member States and partners on all aspects of the pandemic response, including facilitating research, developing guidance, coordinating vaccine development and distribution, and monitoring daily case numbers and trends around the world. Since April 2020, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, launched by WHO and partners, has supported the fastest, most coordinated, and successful global effort in history to develop tools to fight a disease. COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the ACT-Accelerator is a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. WHO provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination. WHO also leads work to improve global capacity and access to oxygen production, distribution and supply to patients. Although WHO announced the end of the emergency phase of COVID-19 in May 2023, the Organization continues to coordinate the global response.

As an application, we use our result to determine the existence and uniqueness of solutions to an equation describing a specific type of choice behavior model for the learning process of the paradise fish. Finally, we present some concrete examples where, using numerical techniques, we obtain approximations to the solution of the functional equation. As the straightforward Picard's iteration can be very expensive, we show that an analytical suboptimal least-squares approximation can be chosen in practice, resulting in very good accuracy.

The virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or more commonly, SARS-CoV-2. It started spreading at the end of 2019 and became a pandemic disease in 2020. Coronavirus Enlarge image Close Coronavirus Coronavirus Coronaviruses are a family of viruses. These viruses cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads most commonly through the air in tiny droplets of fluid between people in close contact. Many people with COVID-19 have no symptoms or mild illness. But for older adults and people with certain medical conditions, COVID-19 can lead to the need for care in the hospital or death. Staying up to date on your COVID-19 vaccine helps prevent serious illness, the need for hospital care due to COVID-19 and death from COVID-19 . Other ways that may help prevent the spread of this coronavirus includes good indoor air flow, physical distancing, wearing a mask in the right setting and good hygiene. Medicine can limit the seriousness of the viral infection. Most people recover without long-term effects, but some people have symptoms that continue for months. Are you fully protected? Create your personalized vaccination plan. Create my plan Symptoms Typical COVID-19 symptoms often show up 2 to 14 days after contact with the virus. Symptoms can include: Dry cough. Shortness of breath. Loss of taste or smell. Extreme tiredness, called fatigue. Digestive symptoms such as upset stomach, vomiting or loose stools, called diarrhea. Pain, such as headaches and body or muscle aches. Fever or chills. Cold-like symptoms such as congestion, runny nose or sore throat. People may only have a few symptoms or none. People who have no symptoms but test positive for COVID-19 are called asymptomatic. For example, many children who test positive don't have symptoms of COVID-19 illness. People who go on to have symptoms are considered presymptomatic. Both groups can still spread COVID-19 to others. Some people may have symptoms that get worse about 7 to 14 days after symptoms start. Most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms. But COVID-19 can cause serious medical complications and lead to death. Older adults or people who already have medical conditions are at greater risk of serious illness. COVID-19 may be a mild, moderate, severe or critical illness. In broad terms, mild COVID-19 doesn't affect the ability of the lungs to get oxygen to the body. In moderate COVID-19 illness, the lungs also work properly but there are signs that the infection is deep in the lungs. Severe COVID-19 means that the lungs don't work correctly, and the person needs oxygen and other medical help in the hospital. Critical COVID-19 illness means the lung and breathing system, called the respiratory system, has failed and there is damage throughout the body. Rarely, people who catch the coronavirus can develop a group of symptoms linked to inflamed organs or tissues. The illness is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. When children have this illness, it is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, shortened to MIS -C. In adults, the name is MIS -A. When to see a doctor Contact a healthcare professional if you test positive for COVID-19 . If you have symptoms and need to test for COVID-19 , or you've been exposed to someone with COVID-19 , a healthcare professional can help. People who are at high risk of serious illness may get medicine to block the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the body. Or your healthcare team may plan regular checks to monitor your health. Get emergency help right away for any of these symptoms: Can't catch your breath or have problems breathing. Skin, lips or nail beds that are pale, gray or blue. New confusion. Trouble staying awake or waking up. Chest pain or pressure that is constant. This list doesn't include every emergency symptom. If you or a person you're taking care of has symptoms that worry you, get help. Let the healthcare team know about a positive test for COVID-19 or symptoms of the illness. There is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

Sorry something went wrong with your subscription Please, try again in a couple of minutes Retry Causes COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also called SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person, even from someone who is infected but has no symptoms. When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, breathe, sing or talk, their breath may be infected with the COVID-19 virus. The coronavirus carried by a person's breath can land directly on the face of a nearby person, after a sneeze or cough, for example. The droplets or particles the infected person breathes out could possibly be breathed in by other people if they are close together or in areas with low air flow. And a person may touch a surface that has respiratory droplets and then touch their face with hands that have the coronavirus on them. It's possible to get COVID-19 more than once. Over time, the body's defense against the COVID-19 virus can fade. A person may be exposed to so much of the virus that it breaks through their immune defense. As a virus infects a group of people, the virus copies itself. During this process, the genetic code can randomly change in each copy. The changes are called mutations. If the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 changes in ways that make previous infections or vaccination less effective at preventing infection, people can get sick again. The virus that causes COVID-19 can infect some pets. Cats, dogs, hamsters and ferrets have caught this coronavirus and had symptoms. It's rare for a person to get COVID-19 from a pet. Risk factors The main risk factors for COVID-19 are: If someone you live with has COVID-19 . If you spend time in places with poor air flow and a higher number of people when the virus is spreading. If you spend more than 30 minutes in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 . Many factors affect your risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 . How long you are in contact, if the space has good air flow and your activities all affect the risk. Also, if you or others wear masks, if someone has COVID-19 symptoms and how close you are affects your risk. Close contact includes sitting and talking next to one another, for example, or sharing a car or bedroom. It seems to be rare for people to catch the virus that causes COVID-19 from an infected surface. While the virus is shed in waste, called stool, COVID-19 infection from places such as a public bathroom is not common. Serious COVID-19 illness risk factors Some people are at a higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness than others. This includes people age 65 and older as well as babies younger than 6 months. Those age groups have the highest risk of needing hospital care for COVID-19 . Not every risk factor for serious COVID-19 illness is known. People of all ages who have no other medical issues have needed hospital care for COVID-19 . Known risk factors for serious illness include people who have not gotten a COVID-19 vaccine. Serious illness also is a higher risk for people who have: Sickle cell disease or thalassemia. Serious heart diseases and possibly high blood pressure. Chronic kidney, liver or lung diseases. People with dementia or Alzheimer's also are at higher risk, as are people with brain and nervous system conditions such as stroke. Smoking increases the risk of serious COVID-19 illness. And people with a body mass index in the overweight category or obese category may have a higher risk as well. Other medical conditions that may raise the risk of serious illness from COVID-19 include: Cancer or a history of cancer. Type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Weakened immune system from solid organ transplants or bone marrow transplants, some medicines, or HIV . Pregnancy. This list is not complete. Factors linked to a health issue may raise the risk of serious COVID-19 illness too. Examples are a medical condition where people live in a group home, or lack of access to medical care. Also, people with more than one health issue, or people of older age who also have health issues have a higher chance of severe illness. Related information COVID-19: Who's at higher risk of serious symptoms? - Related information COVID-19: Who's at higher risk of serious symptoms? Complications Complications of COVID-19 include long-term loss of taste and smell, skin rashes, and sores. The illness can cause trouble breathing or pneumonia. Medical issues a person already manages may get worse. Complications of severe COVID-19 illness can include: Acute respiratory distress syndrome, when the body's organs do not get enough oxygen. Shock caused by the infection or heart problems. Overreaction of the immune system, called the inflammatory response. Blood clots. Kidney injury. Post-COVID-19 syndrome After a COVID-19 infection, some people report that symptoms continue for months, or they develop new symptoms. This syndrome has often been called long COVID, or post- COVID-19 . You might hear it called long haul COVID-19 , post-COVID conditions or PASC. That's short for post-acute sequelae of SARS -CoV-2. Other infections, such as the flu and polio, can lead to long-term illness. But the virus that causes COVID-19 has only been studied since it began to spread in 2019. So, research into the specific effects of long-term COVID-19 symptoms continues. Researchers do think that post- COVID-19 syndrome can happen after an illness of any severity. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine may help prevent post- COVID-19 syndrome. Prevention The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a COVID-19 vaccine for everyone age 6 months and older. The COVID-19 vaccine can lower the risk of death or serious illness caused by COVID-19 . The COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2024-2025 formula. This vaccine is available for people age 6 months and older. Among people with a typical immune system: Children ages 6 months up to age 4 years are up to date after three doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. If a child has had one dose of a previous Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine, two doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine will bring the child up to date. If a child had two doses previously, one dose of the 2024-2025 formula will bring the child up to date. People age 5 and older are up to date with one 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 2024-2025 formula. This vaccine is available for people age 6 months and older. Among people with a typical immune system: Children ages 6 months up to age 4 are up to date if they've had two doses of a 2024-2025 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. If a child has had previous Moderna COVID vaccines, one dose of the 2024-2025 vaccine will bring the child up to date. People age 5 and older are up to date with one 2024-2025 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, adjuvanted 2024-2025 formula. This vaccine is available for people age 12 years and older. Among people with a typical immune system: People age 12 years and older are up to date if they've had one dose of a 2024-2025 Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. In general, people age 5 and older with typical immune systems can get any vaccine approved or authorized for their age. They usually don't need to get the same vaccine each time. Some people should get all their vaccine doses from the same vaccine maker, including: Children ages 6 months to 4 years. People age 5 years and older with weakened immune systems. People age 12 and older who have had one shot of the Novavax vaccine should get the second Novavax shot in the two-dose series. Talk to your healthcare professional if you have any questions about the vaccines for you or your child. Your healthcare team can help you if: The vaccine you or your child got earlier isn't available. You don't know which vaccine you or your child received. You or your child started a vaccine series but couldn't finish it due to side effects. People with weakened immune systems Your healthcare team may suggest added doses of COVID-19 vaccine if you have a moderately or seriously weakened immune system. The FDA has also authorized the monoclonal antibody pemivibart (Pemgarda) to prevent COVID-19 in some people with weakened immune systems. Control the spread of infection In addition to vaccination, there are other ways to stop the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 . If you are at a higher risk of serious illness, talk to your healthcare professional about how best to protect yourself. Know what to do if you get sick so you can quickly start treatment. If you feel ill or have COVID-19 , stay home and away from others, including pets, if possible. Avoid sharing household items such as dishes or towels if you're sick. In general, make it a habit to: Test for COVID-19 . If you have symptoms of COVID-19 test for the infection. Or test five days after you came in contact with the virus. Help from afar. Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick or has symptoms, if possible. Wash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Cover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces. For example, clean doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters regularly. Try to spread out in crowded public areas, especially in places with poor airflow. This is important if you have a higher risk of serious illness. The CDC recommends that people wear a mask in indoor public spaces if you're in an area with a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital. They suggest wearing the most protective mask possible that you'll wear regularly, that fits well and is comfortable. History of infectious disease outbreaks and vaccines timeline.

The need for action on mental health is indisputable and urgent. Mental health has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being. Mental health is determined by a complex interplay of individual, social and structural stresses and vulnerabilities. Concepts in mental health Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And it is crucial to personal, community and socio-economic development. Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders. It exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next, with varying degrees of difficulty and distress and potentially very different social and clinical outcomes. Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm. People with mental health conditions are more likely to experience lower levels of mental well-being, but this is not always or necessarily the case. Determinants of mental health Throughout our lives, multiple individual, social and structural determinants may combine to protect or undermine our mental health and shift our position on the mental health continuum. Individual psychological and biological factors such as emotional skills, substance use and genetics can make people more vulnerable to mental health problems. Exposure to unfavourable social, economic, geopolitical and environmental circumstances \u2013 including poverty, violence, inequality and environmental deprivation \u2013 also increases people\u2019s risk of experiencing mental health conditions. Risks can manifest themselves at all stages of life, but those that occur during developmentally sensitive periods, especially early childhood, are particularly detrimental. For example, harsh parenting and physical punishment is known to undermine child health and bullying is a leading risk factor for mental health conditions. Protective factors similarly occur throughout our lives and serve to strengthen resilience. They include our individual social and emotional skills and attributes as well as positive social interactions, quality education, decent work, safe neighbourhoods and community cohesion, among others. Mental health risks and protective factors can be found in society at different scales. Local threats heighten risk for individuals, families and communities. Global threats heighten risk for whole populations and include economic downturns, disease outbreaks, humanitarian emergencies and forced displacement and the growing climate crisis. Each single risk and protective factor has only limited predictive strength. Most people do not develop a mental health condition despite exposure to a risk factor and many people with no known risk factor still develop a mental health condition. Nonetheless, the interacting determinants of mental health serve to enhance or undermine mental health. Mental health promotion and prevention Promotion and prevention interventions work by identifying the individual, social and structural determinants of mental health, and then intervening to reduce risks, build resilience and establish supportive environments for mental health. Interventions can be designed for individuals, specific groups or whole populations. Reshaping the determinants of mental health often requires action beyond the health sector and so promotion and prevention programmes should involve the education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare sectors. The health sector can contribute significantly by embedding promotion and prevention efforts within health services; and by advocating, initiating and, where appropriate, facilitating multisectoral collaboration and coordination. Suicide prevention is a global priority and included in the Sustainable Development Goals. Much progress can be achieved by limiting access to means, responsible media reporting, social and emotional learning for adolescents and early intervention. Banning highly hazardous pesticides is a particularly inexpensive and cost\u2013effective intervention for reducing suicide rates. Promoting child and adolescent mental health is another priority and can be achieved by policies and laws that promote and protect mental health, supporting caregivers to provide nurturing care, implementing school-based programmes and improving the quality of community and online environments. School-based social and emotional learning programmes are among the most effective promotion strategies for countries at all income levels. Promoting and protecting mental health at work is a growing area of interest and can be supported through legislation and regulation, organizational strategies, manager training and interventions for workers. Mental health care and treatment In the context of national efforts to strengthen mental health, it is vital to not only protect and promote the mental well-being of all, but also to address the needs of people with mental health conditions. This should be done through community-based mental health care, which is more accessible and acceptable than institutional care, helps prevent human rights violations and delivers better recovery outcomes for people with mental health conditions. Community-based mental health care should be provided through a network of interrelated services that comprise: mental health services that are integrated in general health care, typically in general hospitals and through task-sharing with non-specialist care providers in primary health care; community mental health services that may involve community mental health centers and teams, psychosocial rehabilitation, peer support services and supported living services; and services that deliver mental health care in social services and non-health settings, such as child protection, school health services, and prisons. The vast care gap for common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety means countries must also find innovative ways to diversify and scale up care for these conditions, for example through non-specialist psychological counselling or digital self-help. WHO response All WHO Member States are committed to implementing the \u201cComprehensive mental health action plan 2013\u20132030\" , which aims to improve mental health by strengthening effective leadership and governance, providing comprehensive, integrated and responsive community-based care, implementing promotion and prevention strategies, and strengthening information systems, evidence and research. In 2020, WHO\u2019s \u201cMental health atlas 2020\u201d analysis of country performance against the action plan showed insufficient advances against the targets of the agreed action plan. WHO\u2019s \u201cWorld mental health report: transforming mental health for all\u201d calls on all countries to accelerate implementation of the action plan. It argues that all countries can achieve meaningful progress towards better mental health for their populations by focusing on three \u201cpaths to transformation\u201d: deepen the value given to mental health by individuals, communities and governments; and matching that value with commitment, engagement and investment by all stakeholders, across all sectors; reshape the physical, social and economic characteristics of environments \u2013 in homes, schools, workplaces and the wider community \u2013 to better protect mental health and prevent mental health conditions; and strengthen mental health care so that the full spectrum of mental health needs is met through a community-based network of accessible, affordable and quality services and supports. WHO gives particular emphasis to protecting and promoting human rights, empowering people with lived experience and ensuring a multisectoral and multistakeholder approach. WHO continues to work nationally and internationally \u2013 including in humanitarian settings \u2013 to provide governments and partners with the strategic leadership, evidence, tools and technical support to strengthen a collective response to mental health and enable a transformation towards better mental health for all.

Exercise can make you feel happier Exercise has been shown to improve your mood and decrease feelings of depression, anxiety, and stress. The authors of a 2019 review found that 10\u201330 minutes of exercise is enough to improve your mood. Exercise may increase brain sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine. These hormones relieve feelings of depression. It may also increase the production of endorphins, which help produce positive feelings and reduce the perception of pain. Stopping to exercise may also affect your mood. A 2017 review found that active people who stopped exercising regularly experienced significant increases in symptoms of depression and anxiety, even after only a few weeks. 2. Exercise can help with weight management Inactivity may play a major factor in weight gain and obesity, which may lead to health complications. Exercise can help you manage your weight by helping with energy expenditure, also known as spending. Your body spends energy in three ways: digesting food exercising maintaining body functions, like your heartbeat and breathing A reduced calorie intake may lower your metabolic rate, which can temporarily delay weight loss. However, regular exercise may increase your metabolic rate. This can burn more calories and help you manage your weight. Combining aerobic exercise with resistance training may also maximize fat loss and muscle mass maintenance. This could help you manage weight, maintain lean muscle, and reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. \u00bb MORE: Learn how to lose weight the healthy way, the Wellos\u2122 way Wellos is owned by RVO Health.

As people age, they tend to lose muscle mass, strength, and function. This leads to an increased risk of injury. Practicing regular physical activity is essential to reducing muscle loss and maintaining strength as you age. Exercise also helps build bone density . The authors of a 2022 review found that regular exercise significantly improved bone density in the lumbar spine, neck, and hip bones. This may help prevent osteoporosis later in life. Impact exercises like gymnastics, running, or soccer may help promote higher bone density than no-impact sports like swimming and cycling. 4. Exercise can increase your energy levels Exercise can help boost your energy levels while helping to reduce fatigue. This may help as a treatment method if you have certain health conditions, such as cancer. Aerobic exercise boosts your cardiovascular system and improves lung health, which may help with energy levels. Your heart pumps more blood as you move, delivering more oxygen to your working muscles. With regular exercise, your heart becomes more efficient at moving oxygen into your blood. Over time, exercise results in less demand on your lungs. This is one of the reasons why you may find yourself getting less and less out of breath during exercise, according to the American Lung Association . 5. Exercise can reduce your risk of chronic disease Regular physical activity is a key factor in reducing your risk of chronic diseases, such as: type 2 diabetes heart disease cancer , such as breast, colorectal, lung, and liver cancer, among other types high LDL cholesterol hypertension 6. Exercise can help skin health Your skin can be affected by the amount of oxidative stress in your body. Oxidative stress occurs when your body\u2019s antioxidant defenses cannot completely repair the cell damage caused by compounds known as free radicals. This can damage the structure of the cells and negatively impact your skin. Intense and exhaustive physical activity may contribute to oxidative damage. However, a 2018 review suggests that regular moderate exercise may actually help alleviate the stress caused by free radicals. The authors of a 2021 review concluded that regular exercise may help delay the appearance of skin aging, prevent psoriasis, and improve venous leg ulcers. 7. Exercise can help your brain health and memory Exercise can improve brain function and protect your memory and thinking skills. To begin with, exercise increases your heart rate. This promotes the flow of blood and oxygen to your brain. It can also stimulate the production of hormones that enhance the growth of brain cells. For example, exercise has been shown to cause the hippocampus to grow in size, which may help improve mental function. This is part of the brain that\u2019s vital for memory and learning. Regular physical activity is important in older adults because it can help slow down the physiological effects of aging in your brain. It may also help reduce changes in the brain that can contribute to conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. 8. Exercise can help with relaxation and sleep quality Regular exercise can help you relax and sleep better . It may help improve your sleep quality because the energy loss that occurs during exercise stimulates restorative processes during sleep. Also, the increase in your body temperature during exercise may help it drop during sleep, which could promote better sleep. A 2018 study conducted over 4 months in people with chronic insomnia found that both stretching and resistance exercise helped improve sleep quality and duration while decreasing the amount of time it takes to fall asleep. 9. Exercise can reduce pain Chronic pain can be debilitating. For many years, the recommendation for treating chronic pain was rest and inactivity. However, the authors of a 2021 review suggest that aerobic exercise may serve as a natural treatment option to provide pain relief and improve quality of life. One way that exercise may help prevent or reduce chronic pain is because it increases your pain tolerance over time. Exercise may also help you control pain associated with various health conditions, including: chronic low back pain fibromyalgia chronic soft tissue shoulder disorder 10. Exercise can promote a better sex life Regular exercise may help improve your sex life . For example, engaging in regular exercise can strengthen your heart, improve blood circulation, tone muscles, and enhance flexibility, all of which may help improve your sex life . A 2018 review of 10 studies found that exercising for at least 160 minutes per week over a 6-month period could help improve erectile function in males. Another 2018 review suggests that regular exercise may help improve sexual satisfaction, arousal, and well-being in females. Regular resistance training may also help increase sex drive . Frequently asked questions Which exercise can you do every day? It\u2019s important to let your body recover between intense resistance and cardiovascular exercise sessions. That said, there are some less intense exercises you can do every day to help you get to 300 minutes per week. These may include walking, cycling, dancing, and skateboarding. What exercises are good for belly fat? According to the British Heart Foundation , you can\u2019t target one specific area of fat to burn off. But, a consistent mixture of aerobic exercise, resistance training, and eating a well-balanced diet can help you burn fat all over your body. Some exercises include swimming, yoga, running, strength training, and rock climbing. \u00bb MORE: Learn how to lose weight the healthy way, the Wellos\u2122 way Wellos is owned by RVO Health.

Regular physical activity can increase the production of hormones that make you feel happier and help you sleep better. The Department of Health and Human Services recommends you aim for 150\u2013300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity throughout the week. Moderate-intensity aerobic activity is anything that gets your heart beating faster, like walking, cycling, or swimming. Activities like running or participating in a fitness class count for vigorous intensity. You can use weights, resistance bands, or your body weight to perform muscle-strengthening exercises.

Medically reviewed by Angelica Balingit, MD \u2014 Written by Cathleen Crichton-Stuart \u2014 Updated on November 25, 2024 Heart health Reduced cancer risk Better mood Gut health Memory Weight loss Diabetes Bones and teeth Better sleep Quick tips Summary Following a healthy diet has many benefits, including building strong bones, protecting the heart, preventing disease, and boosting mood. A healthy diet typically includes nutrient-dense foods from all the major food groups, including lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and fruits and vegetables of many colors. This article discusses the top 10 benefits of a healthy diet and the evidence behind them. Heart health Share on Pinterest Oscar Wong/Getty Images Heart disease is the leading cause of death for adults in the United States, with an estimated 45 million expected to have cardiovascular disease (CVD) by 2050. High blood pressure , or hypertension, is a form of CVD that can lead to : heart attack heart failure stroke The foods people eat can reduce their blood pressure and help keep their hearts healthy. The DASH diet , or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, includes plenty of heart-healthy foods. The program recommends : eating plenty of vegetables , fruits, and whole grains choosing fat-free or low fat dairy products , fish, poultry, beans, and nuts limiting saturated and trans fat intake, such as fatty meats and full-fat dairy products limiting drinks and foods that contain added sugars restricting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day \u2014 ideally 1,500 mg daily \u2014 and increasing consumption of potassium , magnesium, and calci u m In addition to this, high fiber foods are crucial for keeping the heart healthy. The American Heart Association (AHA) states that dietary fiber helps improve blood cholesterol and lowers the risk of: heart disease stroke obesity type 2 diabetes Limiting certain types of fats can also improve heart health. For instance, eliminating trans fats reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. This type of cholesterol causes plaque to collect within the arteries, increasing the risk of a heart attack and stroke. Reduced cancer risk The American Institute for Cancer Research recommends a diet rich in the following to support overall health and potentially reduce the risk of developing cancer: a variety of fruits and vegetables whole grains beans Some people believe that antioxidants in these foods play a key role in preventing cancer. However, according to the National Cancer Institute , while laboratory and animal studies link certain antioxidants to a reduced incidence of free radical damage due to cancer , human trials remain inconclusive. Indeed, doctors advise against using these dietary supplements without consulting them first. Having obesity may increase a person\u2019s risk of developing cancer and result in less favorable outcomes. Maintaining a moderate weight may reduce these risks. Read more about cancer-fighting foods here . Better mood Some evidence suggests a close relationship between diet and mood. According to a 2020 study , diet can affect several factors which, in turn, may impact a person\u2019s mood. These include: blood glucose levels immune activation the gut microbiome The researchers also found that certain diets, such as the Mediterranean diet , may be linked to better mental health. The opposite is true for diets with high amounts of red meat , processed foods, and high fat foods. It is important to note that the researchers highlighted the need for further research into the mechanisms linking food and mental health. If a person suspects they have symptoms of depression , talking with a doctor or mental health professional may help. Improved gut health The colon is full of naturally occurring bacteria, which play an important role in metabolism and digestion. A diet high in fiber may decrease inflammation in the gut. A diet rich in fibrous vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains may provide a combination of prebiotics and probiotics that help good bacteria thrive in the colon. These fermented foods are rich in probiotics : yogurt kimchi sauerkraut miso Prebiotics may help improve a range of digestive issues, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. Improved memory A healthy diet may help maintain cognition and brain health. However, further conclusive research is necessary. A 2023 review concluded that micronutrients , including B vitamins , iron, and polyphenols , play an important role in supporting cognitive health. The following diets incorporate many of these elements and are associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia : Mediterranean diet Nordic diet DASH diet MIND diet Read more about foods to boost brain function here . Weight loss Maintaining a moderate weight can help reduce the risk of chronic health issues. A person who has more weight or obesity may be at risk of developing certain conditions, including : coronary heart disease type 2 diabetes osteoarthritis stroke hypertension certain mental health conditions some cancers Many healthy foods, including vegetables, fruits, and beans , are lower in calories than most processed foods. A person can determine their calorie requirements using guidance from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020\u20132025 . Maintaining a healthy diet can help people stay within their daily limits without monitoring their calorie intake. \u00bb MORE: Learn how to lose weight the healthy way, the Wellos way Wellos is owned by RVO Health.

Diabetes management A healthy diet may help a person with diabetes: manage their blood glucose levels keep their blood pressure within target ranges keep their cholesterol within target ranges prevent or delay complications of diabetes maintain a moderate weight People with diabetes must limit their intake of foods with added sugar and salt. They should also consider avoiding fried foods high in saturated and trans fats. Read about the best foods for diabetes here . Strong bones and teeth A diet with adequate calcium and magnesium is important for strong bones and teeth. Keeping the bones healthy can minimize the risk of bone issues later in life, such as osteoporosis. The following foods are rich in calcium : dairy products kale broccoli canned fish with bones Food manufacturers often fortify cereals, tofu , and plant-based milk with calcium. Magnesium is abundant in many foods, and some of the best sources include : green leafy vegetables nuts seeds whole grains Getting better sleep A variety of factors, including sleep apnea , can disrupt sleep patterns. Sleep apnea occurs when a condition repeatedly blocks the airways during sleep. Risk factors include obesity and drinking alcohol. Reducing alcohol and caffeine intake may help a person gain restful sleep, whether they have sleep apnea or not. Quick tips for a healthy diet There are plenty of small ways to improve a person\u2019s diet, including : swapping sweetened drinks for water or herbal tea choosing whole grains instead of refined carbohydrates adding more fruits and vegetables to your meals limiting red and processed meats and opting for leaner meats instead Summary Healthy eating has many benefits, such as reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. A person may also boost their mood and gain more energy by maintaining a balanced diet. A doctor or dietitian can provide further tips for eating healthier.

If your IQ is high, then your model is good, and you are rarely surprised by events in the world. If your IQ is low, your model is lousy, and you are shocked, surprised, easily deceived and then ultimately flabbergasted when you are betrayed by the institutions you once trusted. If you believed that COVID vaccines were safe and effective, for example, your mental model failed, and your IQ was very low (some people got smarter since then). Currently, if you believe that the U.S. dollar is \"money\" and that debt doesn't matter, your mental model is faulty and you will be shocked by what comes next in the financial world when the U.S. banking system implodes. NOT buying gold and silver right now (or possibly crypto if you can stomach the volatility) is actually, in my opinion, a sign of stupidity. Those who have good mental models tend to: 1) Completely distrust official sources and so-called \"authorities.\" 2) Have self-confidence in their critical reasoning skills, allowing them to contradict the popular herd / mob when that mob goes insane (which happens frequently). 3) Have studied history and have learned from the mistakes made by previous generations and nations. 4) Are immune to social influence \"herding\" influences that defeat most people. 5) Are also immune to most emotional appeals that attempt to bypass critical reasoning through invoked emotions. A good self-test in all this is to ask yourself if you are surprised (or not) by rising food inflation, or by Trump's failure to end the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East (as he promised). If you are shocked by the falling purchasing power of your dollar, then you need a new mental model that's more accurate. That model isn't found at CNBC, it's found in the work of people like Ron Paul and G. Edward Griffin. Not intended as a brag, but people like myself, and Greg Reese, and Ann Vandersteel, and Catherine Austin Fitts and Michael Yon are rarely surprised by anything, because we've already foreseen where this is all headed (and who the major players are). That's not to say we aren't surprised by singular events like the murder of Charlie Kirk, but we absolutely are not surprised by the broad strokes of how history is unfolding. In fact, my friend Michael Yon has called almost everything you are seeing right now. He's also an avid reader and collector of historical books. You should follow him at @Michael_Yon on X.
